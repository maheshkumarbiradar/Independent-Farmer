A Soil Moisture Monitoring for Different Crops
This project provides a smart soil moisture monitoring system that helps farmers optimize irrigation based on real-time moisture levels. It allows users to set moisture thresholds for different crops and receive data via a mobile app.

🚀 Features
Real-time soil moisture monitoring using ESP8266 & Soil Moisture Sensor
Bluetooth communication for data transfer
Mobile app (built with Kodular, future transition to Android Studio)
Predefined moisture thresholds for different crops
Live connection status monitoring
🛠️ Technologies Used
Hardware: ESP8266, Soil Moisture Sensor
Software: Arduino IDE, Kodular (future Android Studio)
Communication: Bluetooth
📌 Future Enhancements
Integrate Wi-Fi & Firebase for cloud data storage
Implement AI-based irrigation recommendations
Expand mobile app with real-time analytics
Shift from Kodular to Android Studio for advanced UI/UX
📖 Setup Instructions
Connect the ESP8266 with the soil moisture sensor.
Upload the Arduino code for data transmission.
Pair the device with the Kodular app via Bluetooth.
Set crop-specific moisture thresholds and monitor live data.
